###What is /r/zsh about?
[Zsh](http://www.zsh.org/) is a shell designed for interactive use, although it is also a powerful scripting language.

###Before asking questions...
Please check on the [zshwiki.org FAQ](http://zshwiki.org/home/docs/wikifaq) and the official 
[FAQ](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/FAQ/) before asking questions.

If your script behaves strange, please check it with [shellcheck](http://www.shellcheck.net/) -
it is made for bash scripts but also works with zsh for the most part.

Learning resources can be found in our [wiki](/r/zsh/wiki).

###What does zsh different from bash/ksh/...?
* zsh completion is fast, interactive and shows the meanings of flags
* highly customizeable
* automatically parses files for different commands
  (known_hosts for ssh, services for systemctl, ...)
* right-hand prompt
* fuzzy directory/file completion
* suffix aliases
* ... much more
